Economy of mechanism: hardware and software should be as simple and small as possible. simple, small design is easier to test and verify
thoroughly.

Fail-safe default: 

Complete mediation: system should use a list where access of each user is verified rather than relying on cache.

Open Design: system algorithms should be public so experts can review the algorithem i.e: encryption

Separation of privilege: use of password and smart card to access paths

Least privilege: role based access control, each user will have different roles

Least common mechanism: minimize the functions shared by different users, providing mutual security
it helps in reducing number of unintended communication paths and reduces the amount of hardware
and software on which all users depend
